					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
					<p>
                        I am a dedicated and experienced professional with a Master's degree in Engineering and a strong background in manufacturing and design. My dissertation focused on the fabrication of wearable sensors using laser-induced graphene, a cutting-edge technology that has significant potential in the field of bioelectronics and soft actuators. I have utilized various techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Raman Spectroscopy to analyze and understand the properties of the graphene material.
                    </p>
                       <p>
                        In my professional experience, I have worked in various roles, including as a Manufacturing Engineer at Tabriz Petrochemical Company, an Intern at Tabriz Oil Refining Company, and a Laser Cutter Operator at a Local Workshop. These roles have allowed me to gain a comprehensive understanding of manufacturing processes, mechanical design, and the use of CAD/CAE software. I have also worked in a Jewelry Workshop, where I gained hands-on experience in fabricating jewelry pieces.
                       </p> 
                        <p>
                        In addition to my practical experience, I have completed several projects at the University of Tabriz, where I used software like Solidworks, ANSYS, and Abaqus for designing and analyzing various components and structures. These projects have honed my skills in 3D modeling, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and the use of CAD/CAE software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am now looking for a lab that focuses on the development and application of laser-induced graphene and other advanced materials. I am particularly interested in roles that involve the design, fabrication, and testing of wearable sensors and other devices using these materials. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of this field and apply my skills and knowledge to real-world applications.
